There was another CP question which I tried to make (I ended up spending most of my time on making that question) but alas I couldn't solve it myself.  

The question is as follows:  
You are given N points each having coordinates (x,y). Your task is to find the polygon formed by these points such that the area enclosed by them is minimum.  
Additional constraints are that one point can and must be connected to exactly 2 other points and none of the edges of the polygon can intersect.  
You can assume that N is always more than 3.  
Hint: The polygon need not be convex!
